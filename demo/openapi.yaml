      # Schedule & Attendance


      The `Schedule` data objects in the 

      [SIF NZ Data Model](http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/NZ/3.2-rc2/DomainMap.html#Domain__ScheduleAttendance)

      have been designed to be as flexible as possible to accomodate the myriad of different scheduling and timetabling structures used within 

      the New Zealand Education System. 


      ## Schedule, AcademicDay, Period and BellSchedule

      <img src="domains/schedule/Figure_1a.png" usemap="#Figure_1aMap" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"/>

      <div style="text-align:center"><strong>Figure 1a: Schedules, Days & Periods</strong></div>

      </map>


      A Schedule is set up by a `Provider` to manage their timetable for their students, teachers, curriculum

      and resources for part or all of a calendar year. 


      The structure of a Schedule is held in the `Schedule`, `ScheduleAcademicDay`, `SchedulePeriod` and

      `BellSchedule` data objects.


      A Schedule can be considered a rotation of one or more **academic days**, defined by a `ScheduleAcademicDay`

      object. Each academic day represents a regular structured day undertaken by the Provider. The academic days do

      not have to have the same structure across a single rotation through the `Schedule`. For instance, at Hogwarts

      High, days A through D are made of 5 periods, each of which are defined by `SchedulePeriod`, with day E only

      consisting of 4 periods with the last period longer than usual (2 hours instead of 1 hour.

       Based on the two types of day structures (A - D and E), Hogwarts High can assign one of two Bell schedules, held within the
      `BellSchedule` data object. The Bell schedules defines when each Period of the `ScheduleAcademicDay` begins and

      ends, e.g. Period 1 is 9am - 9:50am, Period 2 is 10am - 10:50am etc.


      Figure 1, below, depicts the period structure and bell schedules of the two academic days at Hogwarts High:

      - **Days A through D** have 5 periods of equal length, with a break between periods 2 & 3; and a longer lunch break between periods 3 & 4.

      - **Day E** - has a similar structure, except period 4 takes up the whole afternoon.

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center"><strong>Figure 1: Hogwarts High Schedule for secondary school years</strong></div>



      A school may have multiple schedule structures for different year groups. For instance, a composite school, the

      primary school level students may have a bell schedule different to that of secondary school students. Figure2,

      below, depicts the bell schedule for the primary level students at Hogwarts High. 



      ![Hogwarts High Schedule for primary school years](domains/schedule/Figure_2.png)

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center;"><strong>Figure 2: Hogwarts High Schedule for primary school years</strong></div>


      ## Schedule Dates


      Once defined, the structure of the `Schedule` can be mapped to a specific calendar date as needed. The mapping

      between academic days and schedule periods to specific calendar days is held in the `ScheduleDate` data object.

      Each calendar date is associated with an `ScheduleAcademicDay`, which in turn is associated with the relevant 

      `BellSchedule` and `SchedulePeriod`.


      For example, at Hogwarts High for the secondary level students, academic days A through D take place on Mondays

      to Thursdays and academic day E on Friday. If 1st of July is a Monday, which is academic day A, the bell schedule

      and period for academic day A apply to 1st of July. Similarly, the bell schedule and the periods for each of the

      academic days B to E can be applied to July 2nd to July 5th, as shown below.

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center;"><strong>Figure 4: Hogwarts High Schedule for primary years with Academic Days mapped to Schedule Periods</strong></div>



      ## Teaching Group Timetable


      The `Schedule` can also be used to create the providers' teaching groups. A teaching group's timetable

      specifies the `ScheduleAcademicDay` it is being taught on, the curriculum being taught, who is being taught

      and the assigned location. This timetable is held in the `TeachingGroupEvent` data object.


      Below is an example of the timetable for Hogwart’s Purple teaching group, which follows the Secondary level

      `Schedule`, and Yellow teaching group which follows the Primary level `Schedule`.



      ![Hogwarts High Secondary Teaching Group Purple Schedule](domains/schedule/Figure_5.png)

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center;"><strong>Figure 5: Hogwarts High Secondary Teaching Group Purple Schedule</strong></div>



      ![Hogwarts High Primary Teaching Group Purple Schedule](domains/schedule/Figure_6.png)

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center;"><strong>Figure 6:Hogwarts High Primary Teaching Group Purple Schedule</strong></div>



      Combining the teaching group’s timetable from TeachingGroupEvent data object with the calendar date assignment

      data from ScheduleDate data object gives a completed date specific timetable for Hogwarts Purple teaching groups.



      ![Hogwarts High Secondary Teaching Group Purple Schedule with Dates](domains/schedule/Figure_7.png)

      <div style="margin-top:-1.2em; text-align:center;"><strong>Figure 7: Hogwarts High Secondary Teaching Group Purple Schedule with Dates</strong></div>



      It works just as well for simple timetables, with straightforward morning and afternoon periods as per the

      Yellow teaching group example below.

      ## Schedule Variations


      Every so often one off events will occur that may impact the regular schedule. These one off events could

      impact a single date, or multiple dates, or one or more periods on a specific date(s). 


      Events that impact the schedule are held in the `ScheduleEvent` data object. There is a set of predefined

      standardised effects an event may have.  (Note: Providers also have the ability to create custom effects

      if one of the standardised options does not provide the required change to the schedule.) 


      ### Standardised Effects


      |Standard Effect|Effect Description|

      |---|---|

      |No effect|This event has no effect on the school schedule, but it is recorded for display purposes.|

      |Pause Schedule Rotation|Temporarily suspend the academic day rotation until a subsequent Resume Schedule event occurs.|

      |Resume Schedule Rotation|Resume an academic day rotation previously suspended (paused).|

      |Renumber Schedule Rotation|This event causes the day rotation on the school calendar to be renumbered, starting with any academic days specified as impacted by the event. If any terms are included in the event, those terms are activated effective on the start date of this event.|

      |Insert Day into Rotation|This event causes an insertion in the normal academic day rotation of the schedule. That is to say, any academic days and bell schedules specified in the event are scheduled for the duration of this event, or school is cancelled if there are no academic days specified; after the event ends the academic day rotation resumes from the point at which it was interrupted, e.g. if it was Day 1 before the event, then it will be Day 2 afterwards.|

      |Displace Day in Rotation|This event causes a displacement in the normal academic day rotation of the schedule. That is to say, any academic days or bell schedules specified in the event are scheduled for the duration of this event, or school is cancelled if there are no academic days values specified; after the event ends the rotation resumes from the point it would be at had the event not occurred, e.g. if it was Day 1 before the event, and the event duration was 1 day, then it will be Day 3 afterwards; Day 2 is overwritten by the event.|

      |Start Term|Start one or more terms specified on this date without changing the academic day rotation.|

      |End Term|This event terminates the academic schedule for any term(s) specified in the event. A term is required to be specified when using this schedule effect. Note that events take effect at midnight on the start date, so the designated term(s) do not occur on the actual day of the End Schedule event (i.e. the day prior to the event's start date is the last day the term(s) are in session).|

      |Customised Schedule Effect|This event creates a custom effect; with an arbitrary, customised set of periods and matching bell schedule replacing the normal rotation days of the schedule for the duration of the event.|

      |Cancel Schedule Day|Cancel one or more specified Academic Days that would normally occur on this date. This is generally used to partially cancel the school schedule at the event start time on the event date. To fully cancel school on event date, use either the "insert" or "displace" schedule effect.|

      |Additional Day|Set one or more additional academic days to apply to this calendar date in addition to those defined in the schedule. This can also be used to schedule school on a day on which it would not normally occur, such as a weekend. As a convenience, a list of academic days to remove from the calendar while this event is in effect can also be supplied.|




      ## Terms and Holidays


      Other additional information about the schedule can also be captured such as the length of the terms

      a provider follows, or what holidays are recognised in the area that the provider lives and whether

      or not they impact the schedule, e.g. public holidays, regional holidays. 


      These are stored in ScheduleTerm and ScheduleHoliday respectively.
